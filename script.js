// This is about variable :
// Varibale is just like a box in which you can store something,For example you have books of different categories including (adventure,tourism,self-improvement etc) and you want to label them with the name of there categories so that it becomes easier for you to find the book that specific category. For this you will put a label on box .You will put books of self-improvement in the myFirstBox with the label of self-improvemt and so on..

// There are some tips of declaring a varibale:
// Always declare a variable in the form of camelCase For example:

let myFirstBox = "self-improvement";
let mySecondBox = "Tourism";

// Here i declared a variable with the names of "myFirstBox" & "mySecondBox" and assigning a values of "self-improvement" & "Tourism"

// Variable names cannot start with numbers:
// let 4myFirstBook ="blahhh" =>This code is wrong and you will get an error

// For declaring the varibale you can use dollar sign "($)" , underscore "_"
// let Qas&Joo ="jado" This is wrong as "&" is illegal in declaring variables
let Qasim_Joo = "Jado";
// The above code is right as we using "_" in the middle

// let new = 27; this is wrong as we also cannot declare reserve names as a varibale
// To fix this we use "$" or "_" in the start

let $new = "27";

// we just can use uppercase only for "constant-values" For-example:
PI = 3.1415;
